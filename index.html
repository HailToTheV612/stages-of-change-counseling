                Some may answer “No, not substantially.” But like the lotus in
                the picture above, great beauty can flower from a muddy bottom.
                I believe we are here precisely to grow, and by not changing we
                become stagnant, possibly depressed and at risk of blaming
                others for our being stuck. To start to change, we must have the
                intention to embrace all of ourselves with our dark places as
                well as our strengths. “What we resist, persists,” but from a
                place of acceptance we can become whole.

              <p class="main-text">
                My life has been one of discovery. My careers have spanned the
                gamut of ice-skating instructor, English teacher, psychiatric
                nurse, yoga instructor and currently Counselor. In the process
                of striving to overcome my unique challenges, I have explored
                counseling, physical yoga, yoga philosophy, meditation, polarity
                therapy, reiki and of course graduate school, numerous workshops
                and exhaustive reading. The most powerful healer for me, has
                been meditation. I have found, sitting with myself and
                confronting inner angst is truly transformative. Therefore, much
                of my approach may involve mindfulness techniques, depending on
                a client’s readiness. <br /><br />
                My undergraduate B.A. degree is from Colby College in English,
                R.N. from Excelsior College, and a Graduate Counseling degree
                from Southern Connecticut State University. Professional
                affiliations are with American Counseling Association and
                Connecticut Counseling Association. My internships were in adult
                counseling and substance abuse. I accumulated many years of
                experience working as an R.N. in Psychiatric units of hospitals
                such as Silver Hill, St. Vincent’s (formerly Hall-Brooke
                Hospital) and Griffin Hospital as well as home care psychiatric
                visits.

                While I have often embraced growth and change with excitement,
                many, especially as they become older develop a rigidity. I
                remember as a young person while working on a psychiatric unit,
                I was impressed with some techniques for improving communication
                gleaned from group therapy. I thought it would be a great idea
                to bring home some of them for testing. My father promptly
                informed me that the only one with a problem in the house was
                me. He was comfortable with the status quo of secrets and
                unspoken tensions. Opening up about feelings was a great threat
                to him and he kept his under wraps for most of his life. This
                decision effectively sealed him off from true intimacy with
                others. He was a wonderful person in many ways but speaking
                about feelings was definitely verboten. <br /><br />
                Needless to say, my career has been about the opposite of that.
                I experience joy when others are able to unburden themselves of
                guilt, shame or just sharing being themselves without judgement.
                Deep down, we share many of the same struggles, though the outer
                forms may differ.

                By listening deeply to each client before me, I strive to be
                fully present without preconceptions. By listening with an open
                heart to each person’s struggles, I pull from a lifetime of
                experience. Assessing which approaches may begin a particular
                client’s process of mitigating suffering may result in
                collaborating to start with a behavioral assignment, a cognitive
                restructuring process, dialoging with internal parts to release
                deeply held pain, or simply offering compassionate presence. The
                unique interaction between each individual and myself will yield
                different proscriptive approaches each time,
                <b>I definitely do not use a one size fits all approach.</b>
                Since healing often comes from a place of deep inner peace,
                behavioral homework may involve forms of meditation or
                relaxation to enhance systemic de-stressing. <br /><br />
                For the client’s part, awareness that change takes
                <b>effort</b>, is of paramount importance. Whatever a person’s
                configuration of functioning, it can usually only be changed,
                like building a wall or taking down a wall, brick by brick.
                That’s why my practice is called Stages of Change. Each person’s
                readiness to change and ability to apply focused, persistent
                effort unfolds at their own pace. As a wonderful teacher of mine
                said, “A therapist has maps but the client has to sit in the
                driver’s seat and put their foot on the gas.” <br /><br />
                Albert Ellis used to have clients put a banana on a leash and
                pull it down a crowded New York street to inoculate clients to
                what others’ thought of them! While few would relish a
                behavioral assignment like that, observation of the flow of
                one’s thoughts, courage to feel difficult feelings or journaling
                may help one know oneself at a deeper level. Surprising oneself
                with new capabilities built by taking risks can be deeply
                empowering.

                When I take on a client, I strive to be there for them fully. I
                believe in Edgar Cayce’s philosophy that “We rise to heaven
                leaning on the arm of a brother we have helped.” I hope to
                attract clients that are also committed to their own healing
                process. This involves showing up for sessions on time and
                consistently, working on assignments at their own rate, to the
                best of their abilities. I work to help the client develop more
                peace within themselves. I believe the relationship within
                oneself is primary and causative to everything that happens
                without. I also work collaboratively, welcoming feedback from
                clients about their process so that we can work together to
                confront obstacles to change. The lotus flower above represents
                great beauty and actualization flowering from roots which start
                their growth in a muddy bottom.
