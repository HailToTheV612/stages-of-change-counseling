                  <p class="main-text">Some may answer “No, not substantially.” But like the lotus in the picture above, great beauty can flower from a muddy bottom. I believe we are here precisely to grow, and by not changing we become stagnant, possibly depressed and at risk of blaming others for our being stuck. To start to change, we must have the intention to embrace all of ourselves with our dark places as well as our strengths. “What we resist, persists,” but from a place of acceptance we can become whole.</p>

                  <h1 class="header">About me</h1>
                  <p class="main-text">My life has been one of discovery. My careers have spanned the gamut of ice-skating instructor, English teacher, psychiatric nurse, yoga instructor and currently Counselor. In the process of striving to overcome my unique challenges, I have explored counseling, physical yoga, yoga philosophy, meditation, polarity therapy, reiki and of course graduate school, numerous workshops and exhaustive reading. The most powerful healer for me, has been meditation. I have found, sitting with myself and confronting inner angst is truly transformative. Therefore, much of my approach may involve mindfulness techniques, depending on a client’s readiness.</p>
                  <p class="main-text">My undergraduate B.A. degree is from Colby College in English, R.N. from Excelsior College, and a Graduate Counseling degree from Southern Connecticut State University. Professional affiliations are with American Counseling Association and Connecticut Counseling Association. My internships were in adult counseling and substance abuse. I accumulated many years of experience working as an R.N. in Psychiatric units of hospitals such as Silver Hill, St. Vincent’s (formerly Hall-Brooke Hospital) and Griffin Hospital as well as home care psychiatric visits.</p>

                  <p class="main-text">While I have often embraced growth and change with excitement, many, especially as they become older develop a rigidity. I remember as a young person while working on a psychiatric unit, I was impressed with some techniques for improving communication gleaned from group therapy. I thought it would be a great idea to bring home some of them for testing. My father promptly informed me that the only one with a problem in the house was me. He was comfortable with the status quo of secrets and unspoken tensions. Opening up about feelings was a great threat to him and he kept his under wraps for most of his life. This decision effectively sealed him off from true intimacy with others. He was a wonderful person in many ways but speaking about feelings was definitely verboten.</p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                  Needless to say, my career has been about the opposite of that. I experience joy when others are able to unburden themselves of guilt, shame or just sharing being themselves without judgement. Deep down, we share many of the same struggles, though the outer forms may differ.</p>
